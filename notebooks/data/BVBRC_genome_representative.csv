It is a naturally occurring, Gram-negative, marine bacterium that has long been associated with high mortalities of larval shellfish and significant economic losses in shellfish hatcheries. High mortalities in larval oyster and clam production facilities have been associated with contamination by V. tubiashii and have led to reductions in the availability of seed oysters and clams needed for commercial shellfish planting. Although V. tubiashii has been known for years, the lack of complete genome sequence has slowed the pace of research on this pathogen. Some strains reported to be V. tubiashii, including the American Type Culture Collection [ATCC, Manassas, VA] strain 19105, and strain RE22 were previously misidentified as V. tubiashii and were actually V. coralliilyticus, which is also a shellfish pathogen. In this study, we fully sequenced and annotated the ATCC type strain of V. tubiashii (ATCC 19109) to allow better differentiation between the species and to facilitate research on potential virulence genes and pathogen control mechanisms.","2016-01-17T15:40:42.599Z","2016-01-17T15:40:42.599Z"

Species of Sneathia, which were formerly grouped with Leptotrichia, can be part of the normal microbiota of the genitourinary tracts of men and women, but they are also associated with a variety of clinical conditions including bacterial vaginosis, preeclampsia, preterm labor, spontaneous abortion, post-partum bacteremia and other invasive infections. Sneathia species also exhibit a significant correlation with sexually transmitted diseases and cervical cancer. Because Sneathia species are fastidious and rarely cultured successfully in vitro; and the genomes of members of the genus had until now not been characterized, very little is known about the physiology or the virulence of these organisms. In this project, we describe a novel species, Sneathia amnii sp. nov, which closely resembles bacteria previously designated “Leptotrichia amnionii”. As part of the Vaginal Human Microbiome Project at VCU, a vaginal isolate of S. amnii sp. nov. was identified, successfully cultured and bacteriologically cloned. The biochemical characteristics and virulence properties of the organism were examined in vitro, and the genome of the organism was sequenced, annotated and analyzed.","2016-01-17T15:53:55.064Z","2016-01-17T15:53:55.064Z"

The discovery of three verrucomicrobial Methylacidiphilum strains has revealed diverse metabolic pathways used by these methanotrophs, including mechanisms through which methane is oxidized. The basis of a complete understanding of these processes and of how these bacteria evolved and are able to thrive in such extreme environments partially resides in the complete characterization of their genome and its architecture. Results – In this study, we present the complete genome sequence of Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum SolV, obtained using Pacific Biosciences single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing technology. The genome assembles to a single 2.5Mbp chromosome with an average GC content of 41.5%. The genome contains 2,741 annotated genes and 314 functional subsystems including all key metabolic pathways that are associated with Methylacidiphilum strains, including the CBB pathway for CO2 fixation. However, it does not encode the serine cycle and ribulose monophosphate pathways for carbon fixation. Phylogenetic analysis of the particulate methane mono-oxygenase operon separates the Methylacidiphilum strains from other verrucomicrobial methanotrophs. RNA-Seq analysis of cells growing in three different conditions revealed the deregulation of two out of three pmoCAB operons. In addition, genes involved in nitrogen fixation were upregulated in cells growing in nitrogen fixing conditions, indicating the presence of active nitrogenase. Characterization of the global methylation state of M. fumariolicum SolV revealed methylation of adenines and cytosines mainly in the coding regions of the genome. Methylation of adenines was predominantly associated with 5’-m6ACN4GT-3’ and 5’-CCm6AN5CTC-3’ methyltransferase recognition motifs whereas methylated cytosines were not associated with any specific motif. Conclusions – Our findings provide novel insights into the global methylation state of verrucomicrobial methanotroph M. fumariolicum SolV. However, partial conservation of methyltransferases between M. fumariolicum SolV and M. infernorum V4 indicates potential differences in the global methylation state of Methylacidiphilum strains. Unravelling the M. fumariolicum SolV genome and its epigenetic regulation allow for robust characterization of biological processes that are involved in oxidizing methane. In turn, they offer a better understanding of the evolution, the underlying physiological and ecological properties of SolV and other Methylacidiphilum strains.","2016-01-17T15:49:03.849Z","2016-01-17T15:49:03.849Z"

Most of the isolates required sea water for growth, suggesting them being adapted to the marine environment. Phylogenetic analysis of Streptomyces spp. revealed two isolates originating from different sponges and having 99.7 % identity in their 16S rRNA gene sequences, suggesting that they might represent very closely related strains. Draft sequencing, annotation, and analysis of the genomes of these Streptomyces isolates clearly indicated that they had a common terrestrial ancestor, Streptomyces albus. Targeted analysis of the secondary metabolite biosynthesis genes in two genomes suggested recent acquisition of the gene cluster for enterocin by both isolates. Despite overall high similarity of the housekeeping genes in the two studied Streptomyces isolates and S. albus, certain secondary metabolite biosynthesis genes were shown to be differentially acquired or lost, supporting the hypothesis of divergent evolution in two sponge species.","2016-01-17T15:33:46.477Z","2016-01-17T15:33:46.477Z"

This database, which is still growing, comprises data collected from multiple collaborators. Diagnostic test manufacturers develop sequence-based tests to identify infectious agents and/or to detect resistance or virulence markers; will use this database to advance their development programs and to support the regulatory science review of such tests. This work will facilitate the development of these tests, which are aimed at improving patient outcomes. Continued success of the database and adoption by the community is contingent on populating and curating the database, which in turn will support development of guidance and standards for clinical use of this technology. Discussions held at a relating public workshop on advancing regulatory science for high throughput sequencing devices for microbial identification and detection of antimicrobial resistance markers were essential to establish the safety and effectiveness of these devices.","2016-03-01T20:13:27.521Z","2016-03-01T20:13:27.521Z"

SE50/110 is known as the wild type producer of the ?-glucosidase inhibitor acarbose, a potent drug used worldwide in the treatment of type-2 diabetes mellitus. Derived strains with increased acarbose yield are used in large scale industrial batch fermentation since 1990. Here, we present the complete genome sequence of Actinoplanes sp. SE50/110, the first publicly available genome of the genus Actinoplanes, comprising various producers of pharmaceutically and economically important secondary metabolites. The genome features a high mean G+C content of 71.32% and consists of one circular chromosome with a size of 9,239,980 bp hosting 8,270 predicted protein coding sequences. Bioinformatic classification of the protein sequences revealed an emphasis on enzymes involved in metabolism including a high number of substrate importers, putatively enabling Actinoplanes sp. SE50/110 to live on various carbon sources in diverse habitats. Full genome phylogenetic analysis revealed a rather distant relation to other sequenced species of the family Micromonosporaceae whereas Actinoplanes utahensis was found to be the closest species based on 16S rDNA comparison alone. The genome hosts several new non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS), polyketide synthases (PKS) and hybrid clusters, potentially coding for new antibiotics and / or other bioactive compounds. Another key feature of the genome represents the discovery of a functional actinomycete integrative and conjugative element (AICE) which may be used as a system for future genetic modification of Actinoplanes sp.

Formosa constitutes a Bacteroidetes genus within the class Flavobacteria, whose members have been found in marine habitats with high levels of organic matter, such as in association with algae, invertebrates and fecal pellets. Here we report on the generation and analysis of the genome of the Formosa agariphila type strain KMM 3901T – an isolate from the green algae Acrosiphonia sonderi. F. agariphila is a facultative anaerobe with the capacity for mixed acid fermentation and denitrification. Its genome harbors 129 proteases and 88 glycoside hydrolases, indicating a pronounced specialization on the degradation of proteins, polysaccharides and glycoproteins. 65 of the glycoside hydrolases are organized in at least 13 distinct polysaccharide utilization loci, where they are clustered with TonB-dependent receptors, SusD-like proteins, sensors/transcription factors, transporters and oftentimes sulfatases. These loci play a pivotal role in bacteroidetal polysaccharide biodegradation, and in the case of F. agariphila revealed the capacity to degrade a wide range of algal polysaccharide from green, red and brown algae and thus a strong adaption towards an algae-associated lifestyle.","2014-12-08T22:39:44.623Z","2015-03-16T03:17:09.594Z"

Natural products still remain the leading source for new medications. However, traditional natural product research struggles with frequent rediscoveries of already known natural products and tedious workload. This downsides can be avoided by employing the genome mining approach. This method enables researchers to assess the natural biosynthetic potential of an organism by analysing the sequenced genome for conserved natural product biosynthesis gene cluster. Especially neglected bacteria that were overlooked as natural product producers in the past show promising biosynthesis potential. The soft rot mushroom pathogen Janthinobacterium agaricidamnosum represents such a neglected bacterium.

This approach also allows rapid insights into the biosynthetic potential of microorganisms isolated from unexploited habitats and ecosystems, which in many cases may prove difficult to culture and manipulate in the laboratory. Streptomyces leeuwenhoekii C34 was isolated from the hyper-arid high-altitude Atacama Desert in Chile and shown to produce novel polyketide antibiotics. Results Here we present the de novo sequencing of the S. leeuwenhoekii C34 linear chromosome (8 Mb) and two extrachromosomal replicons, the circular pSLE1 (86 kb) and the linear pSLE2 (132 kb), all in single contigs, obtained by combining Pacific Biosciences SMRT (PacBio) and Illumina MiSeq technologies. We identified the biosynthetic gene clusters for chaxamycin, chaxalactin, hygromycin A and desferrioxamine E, metabolites all previously shown to be produced by this strain (J Nat Prod, 2011, 74:1965) and an additional 31 putative gene clusters for specialised metabolites. As well as gene clusters for polyketides and non-ribosomal peptides, we also identified three gene clusters encoding novel lasso-peptides. Conclusions The S. leeuwenhoekii C34 genome contains 35 gene clusters apparently encoding the biosynthesis of specialised metabolites, most of them completely novel and uncharacterised. This project has served to evaluate the current state of NGS for efficient and effective genome mining of high GC actinomycetes. The PacBio technology now permits the assembly of actinomycetes replicons into single contigs with >99% accuracy. Assembled Illumina sequencing permitted not only the correction of the omissions found in GC homopolymers (exacerbated by the high GC content of actinomycetes DNA) but more importantly to obtain the terminus of the chromosome and a linear plasmid not assembled by PacBio. We propose an experimental pipeline that uses the Illumina assembled contigs, in addition to just the reads, to complement the current limitations of the PacBio sequencing technology and assembly software.","2016-01-17T16:03:54.081Z","2016-01-17T16:03:54.081Z"

In spite of the importance of the pathogen, whole genome sequence was not reported till date. Therefore, in the present study, genome sequence of P. cichorii JBC1 was revealed for the first time and its different groups of genes were annotated. The genome of JBC1 is 5,986,012 bp in size and with average GC ratio of 58.1%. It encodes for 5,174 coding sequences (CDS) and among them, 4,218 CDS (81.52%) were with known function, while with 956 CDS (18.47%) were with unknown function. In addition, it encodes for 19 rRNA and 65 tRNA also. The genes related to virulence, transport mechanism, phytotoxic compound, secondary metabolite products were analyzed and the genome was compared with eight other Pseudomonas species, to understand species level diversity. In spite of high percentages of similarity, significant diversity was found among the different Pseudomonas species at genome level. Especially, comparison of pathogenicity island region indicated more divergence, which gave clue for difference in host specificity and degree of virulence. In addition, the presence of genes to antibiotic resistance and tolerance to heavy metal tolerance, and incorporation of prophage genome was also analyzed. The genome sequence of JBC1 will be a reference sequence for other P. cichorii strains, and useful resource for further needful research for development of pathogen control measures.'","2014-12-08T22:12:38.311Z","2015-03-16T03:17:09.594Z"

Human infections are associated with trauma, toxic shock and often-fatal gynaecological infections. Some strains are known to produce the large clostridial cytotoxins TcsH and TcsL, relatives of the cytotoxins found in C. difficile, C. novyi and C. perfringens. These 4 strains are part of a larger collection that reveal a diverse phylogenetic distribution. Although all strains originated from animal or clinical disease, only 5 strains contained cytotoxin genes: 4 strains contain tcsL alone and one strain contains tcsL and tcsH. Where present, tcsL and tcsH were localised on a pathogenicity locus, distinct to that present in C. difficile. In contrast to C. difficile, the C. sordellii tcsL and tcsH genes were always localised on plasmids, designated pCS1-1 in strain ATCC9714 and pCS1-3 in strain JGS6382. Phylogenetic analysis suggests gain and loss of entire toxigenic plasmids in addition to horizontal transfer of the pathogenicity locus. A high quality, annotated draft sequence of ATCC9714 reveals many putative virulence factors including genes for neuraminidase, phospholipase C and a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin sordellilysin that are highly conserved between all strains sequenced here. Our finding suggest that the cytotoxins may not be the primary virulence factors in the majority of infections, but that acquisition of these toxins may precipitate severe infection","2016-01-17T15:49:04.904Z","2016-01-17T15:49:04.904Z"

There is a duplicated pathogenicity island that has also been detected in strain LVS and mutations in the iglA, iglC, or pdpD genes affect the ability of the pathogen to survive in macrophages. The genome also contains genes for type IV pili production and capsular polysaccharide genes similar to those of Bacillus anthracis as well as numerous ABC transporters. There are a large number of insertion sequences including a mariner element, which is a transposon typically found in eukaryotes and is the first instance of this element to be found in a microbe, which may have acquired it during transit through one of the insect vectors.","2014-12-08T22:11:39.248Z","2015-03-16T03:17:09.594Z"

This genus comprises about 150 metabolically diverse species of anaerobes that are ubiquitous in virtually all anoxic habitats where organic compounds are present, including soils, aquatic sediments and the intestinal tracts of animals and humans. Characteristic of clostridia is the shape of their cells that resembles a drumstick or spindle ('kloster' is Greek for 'spindle'). This shape is attributed to the presence of endospores that develop under conditions unfavorable for vegetative growth and distend single cells terminally or sub-terminally. The endospores of many species are extremely sturdy and survive extended boiling in water and exposure to air. Spores germinate under conditions favorable for vegetative growth, such as anaerobiosis and presence of organic substrates. From the evolutionary perspective, clostridia are considered to be the most ancient bacteria. It is believed that present day Mollicutes (Eubacteria) have evolved regressively (i.e., by genome reduction) from gram-positive clostridia-like ancestors with a low GC content in DNA. Several species of clostridia (e.g., C. perfringens, C. botulinum, C. tetani) are known opportunistic toxin-producing pathogens in animals and humans. Some species are capable of producing organic solvents (acetone, ethanol, etc,), molecular hydrogen and other useful compounds. There are also species that can fix molecular nitrogen and thus are important participants in biological turnaround of nitrogen compounds in nature.  Clostridium perfringens. This organism is a causative agent of a wide spectrum of necrotic enterotoxicoses. In humans it is responsible for such diseases as gas gangrene (clostridial myonecrosis), food poisoning, necrotizing enterocolitis of infants and enteritis necroticans (pigbel). It also causes such animal diseases as lamb dysentery, ovine enterotoxemia (struck), pulpy kidney disease in lambs and other enterotoxemias in lambs and calves.  The bacterium is one of the most widely distributed pathogens in nature. It is commonly found in the environment (soil, sewage) and in the animal and human gastrointestinal tract as a member of the normal microflora. It is a fast growing (generation time 8-10 min) anaerobic flesh-eater. Active fermentative growth is accompanied by profuse generation of molecular hydrogen and carbon dioxide. Unlike most other clostridia, C. perfringens is non-motile. It is also oxygen tolerant which makes it an easy object to work with in laboratories. Systems for genetic manipulation of C. perfringens have been developed and the species became a model organism in clostridial genetic studies.  Known isolates belong to five distinct types (A, B, C, D, and E) that are distinguished based on the specific extracellular toxins they produce. Each of the toxins is responsible for a specific disease syndrome.

In exchange for these services, the bacterium receives essential metabolites from the host in order to function. For example, the bacteria produce citrulline which the host uses to produce arginine which the bacteria then catabolizes.

The first, and larger chromosome, contains many essential cell functions, as well as virulence genes contained within pathogenicity islands (PAIs). One major pathogenicity determinant is encoded within a PAI that is contained inside an integrated phage (CTXphi) on chromosome 1 that codes for the cholera toxin, an adenylate cyclase. Once the toxin is injected into host cells, it results in secretion of chlorine ions, which leads to increased water secretion, dehydration, and eventually, death. Up to 20 litres of water a day may be lost. The second chromosome also has important cell functions, but has a preponderance of genes associated with energy and transport functions, including signal transduction systems, and in addition, DNA repair enzymes. Chromosome 2 also has the integron island, a large variable region of the chromosome that functions as a gene capture system, some of which are associated with antibiotic resistance. There are 105 genes that have copies on both chromosomes.","2014-12-08T22:13:45.666Z","2015-03-16T03:17:09.594Z"

This strain was isolated in mice from an infected tick. The most significant difference between the genome of E. ruminantium and those of the other Rickettsiales is the presence of a large number of repetitive sequences. These repeats make up 8.5% of the genome and consist of simple sequence repeats (SSRs), large tandem repeats, and dispersed repeats. These repeats are associated with 29 of the 32 pseudogenes which appear to have occured primarily through duplication events. In addition, it is thought that the SSRs may play a role in regulation or phase variation. Between 10-15% of the genes in free-living bacteria are thought to have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer. Intracellular bacteria have limited exposure to other bacteria and therefore a smaller portion of their genome is from other organisms. It is estimated that only 3% of the genome of E. ruminantium has been obtained by gene transfer. The existence of a large number of repeat elements may be a alternative strategy for increasing genetic diversity and improve the evolutionary fitness of E. ruminantium.","2014-12-08T22:11:10.071Z","2015-03-16T03:17:09.594Z"

It is capable of reductive dechlorination, replacing chlorine with hydrogen, of environmental pollutants such as polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDDs and PCDFs), by utilizing them as electron acceptors during anaerobic respiration. Genome analysis suggests this organism has 32 reductive-dehalogenase-homologous loci, arranged as two genes, rdhA and rdhB. RdhA is thought to be the active subunit while the hydrophobic protein RhdB is presumably a membrane-anchor for RdhA. The rdh loci are typically found in the origin-proximal portion of the chromosome, and are usually transcribed in the direction of DNA replication, suggesting that they are highly expressed. These genes are also associated with genes encoding two-component and other types of regulatory systems, suggesting that these loci are under regulatory control based on environmental stimuli.","2014-12-08T22:11:06.259Z","2015-03-16T03:17:09.594Z"

This organism is a slowly growing species, with doubling times of around 22-24 hours. One of the important diagnostic features of this bacterium is that its growth in laboratory settings depends on the presence of mycobactin J, a natural siderophore. This bacterium is not common in the environment, and is predominantly found as an intracellular parasite. It causes a chronic granulomatous enteritis termed Johne's disease or paratuberculosis. The desease affects domestic and free-ranging ruminants, but has also been reported in primates, rabbits, stoats and foxes. The usually fatal disease is characterized by weight loss and diarrhea, after a long pre-clinical phase. Treatment is ineffective and economically impracticable. Paratuberculosis in domestic livestock entails significant economic losses in the dairy industry totaling $1.5 billion annually. Several reports suggest a role for this organism in the etiology of Crohn's disease, a severe inflammatory bowel disease in humans. Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis strain K-10.

This organism, also known as BT, is famous for the production of an insecticidal toxin. The bacterium was initially discovered as a pathogen of various insects and was first used as an insecticidal agent in the early part of this century. This organism, like many other Bacilli, is found in the soil, where it leads a saprophytic existence, but becomes an opportunistic pathogen of insects when ingested. The specific activity of the toxin towards insects and its lack of toxicity to animals has made this organism a useful biocontrol agent.  The delta-endotoxin, which is produced during the sporulation part of the life cycle, causes midgut paralysis and disruption of feeding by the infected insect host. The presence of a parasporal crystal, which is outside the exosporium of the endospore, is indicative of production of the toxin, and serves as a marker for this species.Activation of the toxin typically requires a high pH environment such as the alkaline environments in insect midguts followed by proteolysis. Binding of the toxin to a receptor on intestinal epithelial cells serves to position the toxin to insert itself into the apical membrane where it forms a pore. The flux of water and ions into the cytoplasm results in eventual lysis leading to tissue damage. Various toxin genes specific for a variety of insects have been studied, and many are now being used in genetically modified plants which have been engineered to produce the toxin themselves, eliminating the need to produce sufficient amounts of B. thuringiensis spores.Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. konkukian serotype H34 strain 97-27. This organism was isolated from a case of severe human tissue necrosis which is unusual since human infections by this organism are rare.

The glucose/sorbitol dehydrogenase is responsible for the oxidation of D-sorbitol, gluconate and glycerol, producing L-sorbose, 5-ketogluconate and dihydroxyacetone, respectively. Other identified membrane-bound dehydrogenases include the alcohol, glucose, and sorbitol dehydrogenases, which are involved in acetate, gluconate, and D-fructose formation, respectively. In addition to the dehydrogenases with a recognized substrate, 75 putative dehydrogenase/oxidoreductases, 23 of which are thought to be membrane bound, have been identified in the genome sequence. Expression studies of G. oxydans grown on glucose has shown that a number of these uncharacterized oxidoreductases are transcribed and presumably have a role in cellular metabolism.The plasmids in G. oxydans strain 621H are not homologous to plasmids from other G. oxydans strains. Identified genes include those for plasmid replication, a DNA helicase II, a restriction/modification system, a heavy metal resistance system and, on the megaplasmid, genes for DNA transfer via conjugation.

This pathogen enters the xylem and spreads throughout the vascular tissue of the plant, which results in wilting of the plant, or to leaf blight if the infection occurs later in development. This organism shares common virulence determinants with Xanthomonas campestris including an hrp (hypersensitive response) system that is a type III secretion system for delivery of effector molecules to the host cell cytoplasm, and avr (avirulence) genes.

The genome of Rickettsia felis strain URRWXCa12 (strain California 2) reveals some unusual features. There are two plasmids (pRF and pRFdelta), the first such identified in the Rickettsia genus, and the pRF plasmid has genes that encode proteins similar to those found on conjugative plasmids such as TraA from Agrobacterium tumefaciens, F plasmid TraD and TraG, and the chromosome encodes proteins similar to the vir genes of A. tumefaciens. The chromosome encodes a protein that is similar to the IncP plasmid primase protein TraC. All of these functions may be involved in pathogenesis and the movement of proteins and DNA and electron microscopy confirmed the evidence of a conjugative pilus in this organism as well as other fimbriae.The genome exhibited a large number of repetitive elements, including 82 transposase genes, and genomic comparisons with other Rickettsia indicates a large number of inversions and translocations. These were many Rickettsia palindromic elements (RPEs) found in the genome as well as a large number of surface antigen (sca) genes including split genes that were shown to be transcribed, and genes encoding tricoriticopeptide repeat proteins (TPR) and ankyrin-repeat proteins, both of which may be involved in infection processes. Many global metabolic regulators were also discovered, including fourteen spoT paralogs that regulate cellular metabolism in Escherichia coli in response to starvation conditions and all fourteen were found to be transcribed. Sixteen toxin and fourteen anti-toxin genes were discovered that potentially may be involved in maintaining the presence of the bacteria in the host; possibly by targeting the host cell or in synchronizing the bacterial replication cycles.","2014-12-08T22:12:44.145Z","2015-03-16T03:17:09.594Z"

PCC 7002.The cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 (formerly known as Agmenellum quadruplicatum strain PR-6) was originally isolated in 1961 by Chase Van Baalen from an onshore, marine mud flat sample derived from fish pens on Maguyes Island, La Parguera, Puerto Rico. The organism grows in brackish (euryhaline/marine) water and is unicellular but tends to form short filaments of two to four cells during exponential growth at the temperature optimum of 38oC. The cells are 1.5 to 2.5 mkm in length and lack phycoerythrin and phycoerythrocyanin. Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 can grow heterotrophically with glycerol as substrate, has an obligate requirement for vitamin B12, and most importantly, is naturally transformable. It is among the fastest growing of all cyanobacteria, and has a doubling time of about 3.5 hours under optimal conditions (light intensity ~250 mkmol photons m-2 s-1; nitrogen source urea; 2% (v/v) CO2). The strain is extremely tolerant of high light intensities and has been grown at light intensities equivalent to two suns. This unique combination of physiological and genetic properties have long made this strain an important model system to studies of the oxygenic photosynthetic apparatus, the regulation of carbon and nitrogen metabolism, and other aspects of cyanobacterial physiology and metabolism.","2014-12-08T22:13:40.081Z","2015-03-16T03:17:09.594Z"

The whole genome sequence was established from 55,081 end sequences (giving 9.6X coverage) derived from these libraries using dye terminator chemistry on ABI 3730xl automated sequencers.The aerobic phototrophic bacteria are ubiquitous as plant symbionts, free-living in lakes and ocean surface waters, soils and even near deep sea hydrothermal vents. In fact, ~10% of all microorganisms in marine surface water samples appear to be aerobic phototrophic bacteria, suggesting a significant contribution to the global carbon cycle. Although the numbers of aerobic phototrophic bacteria vary with locale (Goericke, 2002), it is clear that these organisms are a previously unrecognized major component of the bacterial biomass on Earth. The genome sequence of this representative aerobic phototrophic bacteria species will enable discovery in the following three areas: 1) the evolutionary genesis of photosynthesis genes; 2) pathways of carbon dioxide fixation and production;  3) light and oxygen signal transduction in gene expression.Goericke R (2002) Bacteriochlorophyll a in the ocean: Is anoxygenic bacterial photosynthesis important?

Some phenotypes have been found to be non-symbiotic and have either never acquired, or lost the ability to form nodules and are assumed to have different roles in soil. Bradyrhizobium-like species have been shown by many metagenomic studies on soil to be one of the most abundant and active groups. One grassland and one bare fallow Bradyrhizobium isolate were chosen to have their genome sequenced using Ion Torrent and Illumina sequencing platforms. The genomes were assembled using SOAPdenovo2 and manually curated using Geneious. The genomes show distinct genomic differences. Differences between the genomes have been assessed in order to establish the different functions these isolates are able to perform to give clues to their role in the community.","2016-07-06T22:13:44.175Z","2016-07-06T22:13:44.175Z"

Despite this, they remain scarcely studied and mostly uncultured. Based on genomic and experimental data from Nitrospira moscoviensis representing the ubiquitous Nitrospira lineage II, we identified ecophysiological traits that contribute to the ecological success of Nitrospira. Unexpectedly, N. moscoviensis possesses genes coding for a urease and cleaves urea to ammonia and CO2. Ureolysis was not observed yet in nitrite oxidizers and enables N. moscoviensis to supply ammonia oxidizers lacking urease with ammonia from urea, which is fully nitrified by this consortium through reciprocal feeding. The presence of highly similar urease genes in Nitrospira lenta from activated sludge, in metagenomes from soils and freshwater habitats, and of other ureases in marine nitrite oxidizers, suggests a wide distribution of this extended interaction between nitrifiers, which enables nitrite oxidizers to tap urea as a source of energy. A soluble formate dehydrogenase lends additional ecophysiological flexibility and allows N. moscoviensis to utilize formate aerobically, with or without concomitant nitrite oxidation, or anaerobically with nitrate as terminal electron acceptor. Compared to Nitrospira defluvii from lineage I, N. moscoviensis shares the Nitrospira core metabolism but shows substantial genomic dissimilarity including genes for adaptations to elevated oxygen concentrations. Reciprocal feeding and metabolic versatility, including the participation in different nitrogen cycling processes, likely are key factors for the niche partitioning, the ubiquity, and the high diversity of Nitrospira in natural and engineered ecosystems.","2016-01-17T17:04:14.323Z","2016-01-17T17:04:14.323Z"

The JCVI then used yeast genetic tools to delete part of a type III restriction enzyme, a modification that could not be made using existing genetic tools for M. mycoides.

The first stage of the disease is characterized by unilateral wilting of leaves. Wilting then spreads to all leaves, canker lesions develop on the stem and the plant dies. If infection occurs at a late stage of plant development, plants can survive and yield fruit that may have spots, so called bird's eyes. Often the seeds will be infected and this has been the major source for outbreaks of  Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis infections in agriculture. Clavibacter michiganensis subsp.

Mobile elements are abundant. Many encode type IV secretion systems for conjugative transfer pointing to their iportance for adaptation. Although the Dot/Icm secretion system is conserved the core set of substrates is small, as only 24 out of >300 described Dot/Icm effector genes are present in all species.

After checking their purity by clone analysis of 16S rRNA gene and its adjacent ITS, the complete genome sequence was determined using ABI 3730 capillary sequencers and a GS20 system.","2014-12-08T22:13:55.616Z","2015-03-16T03:17:09.594Z"

Therefore, the purpose of this project was to evaluate the effects of commingling, transportation, and antibiotic treatment for the control of bovine respiratory disease complex on the diversity and dynamics of nasopharyngeal and rectoanal mucosal bacterial populations in beef calves.  Three groups of 60 commercial 5-7-month-old male beef calves were used in this study, each originating either from Missouri, Kentucky or Tennessee and were transported to a backgrounding facility in Kansas in late September 2013. On arrival at the facility, calves from within each source were randomly assigned to receive either a macrolide antibiotic or saline injection and assigned to separate pens according to treatment within source for a total of 6 pens; for the duration of the trial, each pen was prevented from nose-to-nose contact with any other pen. Nasopharyngeal samples from these calves were collected at four time points: at the sale barn before transport (day 0), at the backgrounding facility upon arrival (day 1), and 9 and 28 days later. Additionally, calves were monitored daily for signs of BRDC using a clinical illness scoring (CIS) system and rectal temperature cutoff as described in (DeDonder et al., 2015). If a calf met the case definition for BRDC, they were treated with a macrolide antibiotic, and additional nasopharyngeal samples were obtained at the time of classification of onset of BRDC morbidity.  These samples were processed using classical microbiological techniques for bacterial isolation, and some isolates were selected for species identification, antimicrobial resistance testing, and whole genome sequencing. The selection criteria for the nasopharyngeal isolates were either that the bacterial species was not represented by a closed genome in GenBank or that the species was known to be associated with respiratory disease in other mammals.","2016-02-02T21:14:07.314Z","2016-02-02T21:14:07.314Z"

This database, which is still growing, comprises data collected from multiple collaborators. Diagnostic test manufacturers develop sequence-based tests to identify infectious agents and/or to detect resistance or virulence markers; will use this database to advance their development programs and to support the regulatory science review of such tests. This work will facilitate the development of these tests, which are aimed at improving patient outcomes. Continued success of the database and adoption by the community is contingent on populating and curating the database, which in turn will support development of guidance and standards for clinical use of this technology. Discussions held at a relating public workshop on advancing regulatory science for high throughput sequencing devices for microbial identification and detection of antimicrobial resistance markers were essential to establish the safety and effectiveness of these devices.","2016-03-01T20:48:05.614Z","2016-03-01T20:48:05.614Z"

Much of the clinically relevant antibiotic resistance in these bacteria is driven by genes carried on mobile pieces of DNA called plasmids. A particularly significant resistance mechanism called the Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) is capable of hydrolyzing all penicillins, cephalosporins and carbapenems leaving very few therapeutic options for patients infected with blaKPC positive Enterobacteriaeceae. Unfortunately, the tools that we use for tracking of hospital transmission of bacteria do not focus on plasmids but rather the genome of the bacterium which has acquired the plasmid. Our project is to explore the blaKPC plasmid transmission across species in a single institution in Virginia where KPC-producing Gammaproteobacteria are endemic over several years using whole genome sequencing to gain insights into plasmid transmission and evolution of genes of drug resistance.","2016-01-17T16:05:42.704Z","2016-01-17T16:05:42.704Z"

Much of the clinically relevant antibiotic resistance in these bacteria is driven by genes carried on mobile pieces of DNA called plasmids. A particularly significant resistance mechanism called the Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) is capable of hydrolyzing all penicillins, cephalosporins and carbapenems leaving very few therapeutic options for patients infected with blaKPC positive Enterobacteriaeceae. Unfortunately, the tools that we use for tracking of hospital transmission of bacteria do not focus on plasmids but rather the genome of the bacterium which has acquired the plasmid. Our project is to explore the blaKPC plasmid transmission across species in a single institution in Virginia where KPC-producing Gammaproteobacteria are endemic over several years using whole genome sequencing to gain insights into plasmid transmission and evolution of genes of drug resistance.","2016-01-17T16:05:41.690Z","2016-01-17T16:05:41.690Z"

It is a 2.9-billion-year-old formation of low permeability sandstone and shale with minor volcanic units and conglomerates. The ambient temperature of the rock is approximately 60C. Samples were collected from a freshly mined rock surface and from a water-producing borehole that penetrated 121 m horizontally into the formation at a depth of 3,198 m. T. scotoductus SA-01 is a facultative anaerobe capable of coupling the oxidation of organic substrates to reduction of a wide range of electron acceptors, including nitrate, Fe(III), Mn(IV) or S(0) as terminal electron acceptors.

The specific mechanism through which H. typhlonius induces and promotes IBD is not fully understood. Access to the genome sequence is essential to examine emergent properties of this organism, such as its pathogenicity. To this end, we present the complete genome sequence of H. typhlonius, obtained through single-molecule real-time sequencing. The genome was assembled into a single circularized contig measuring 1.92 Mbp with an average GC content of 38.8%. In total 2,117 protein-encoding genes and 43 RNAs were identified. Numerous pathogenic features were found, including a putative pathogenicity island containing components of type IV secretion system, virulence-associated proteins and cag pathogenicity island protein. We compared the genome of H. typhlonius to those of the murine pathobiont Helicobacter hepaticus and human pathobiont Helicobacter pylori. H. typhlonius resembles H. hepaticus most with 1,594 (75.3%) of its genes being orthologous to genes in H. hepaticus. Determination of the global methylation state revealed seven distinct recognition motifs for adenine methylation. H. typhlonius shares four of its recognition motifs with H. pylori. The three remaining motifs are present in H. typhlonius exclusively. The complete genome sequence of H. typhlonius MIT 97-6810 enabled us to identify many pathogenic features suggesting that H. typhlonius can act as a pathogen. Follow-up studies are necessary to evaluate the true nature of its pathogenic capabilities. We found many methylated sites and a plethora of restriction-modification systems. The genome, together with the methylome, will provide an essential resource for forthcoming studies investigating gene regulation, host interaction and pathogenicity of H. typhlonius. In turn, this work can contribute to unraveling the role of Helicobacter in enteric disease.","2016-01-30T15:51:52.909Z","2016-01-30T15:51:52.909Z"

Therefore, the purpose of this project was to evaluate the effects of commingling, transportation, and antibiotic treatment for the control of bovine respiratory disease complex on the diversity and dynamics of nasopharyngeal and rectoanal mucosal bacterial populations in beef calves.  Three groups of 60 commercial 5-7-month-old male beef calves were used in this study, each originating either from Missouri, Kentucky or Tennessee and were transported to a backgrounding facility in Kansas in late September 2013. On arrival at the facility, calves from within each source were randomly assigned to receive either a macrolide antibiotic or saline injection and assigned to separate pens according to treatment within source for a total of 6 pens; for the duration of the trial, each pen was prevented from nose-to-nose contact with any other pen. Nasopharyngeal samples from these calves were collected at four time points: at the sale barn before transport (day 0), at the backgrounding facility upon arrival (day 1), and 9 and 28 days later. Additionally, calves were monitored daily for signs of BRDC using a clinical illness scoring (CIS) system and rectal temperature cutoff as described in (DeDonder et al., 2015). If a calf met the case definition for BRDC, they were treated with a macrolide antibiotic, and additional nasopharyngeal samples were obtained at the time of classification of onset of BRDC morbidity.  These samples were processed using classical microbiological techniques for bacterial isolation, and some isolates were selected for species identification, antimicrobial resistance testing, and whole genome sequencing. The selection criteria for the nasopharyngeal isolates were either that the bacterial species was not represented by a closed genome in GenBank or that the species was known to be associated with respiratory disease in other mammals.","2016-02-02T21:13:41.725Z","2016-02-02T21:13:41.725Z"

Overall they are able to use a large variety of substrates, produce several secondary metabolites and signalling molecules, and form biofilms. While Phaeobacter spp. have very broad substrate spectra, Leisingera spp. are methylotrophic, i.e. they can grow on a very limited number of methylated substrates. This indicates a specific adaptation which is probably reflected in the genome, possibly by loss of genes coding for specific metabolic pathways.The strains proposed to be sequenced originate from diverse marine habitats (mostly natural surfaces) from all over the world, i.e. tidal flats of the North Sea and the Yellow Sea, marine sediments of the Arctic Ocean and the South China Sea, from a marine electroactive biofilm exposed to natural seawater taken at Genoa, Italy, and from seawater collected from a tide pool off the coast of central California. Some strains of this cluster were found to be associated with higher organisms, such as P. gallaeciensis, which was isolated from rearings and collectors of the scallop Pecten maximus (in Galicia, Spain), and M. algicola, which was isolated from a stationary culture of the toxin-producing marine dinoflagellate Prorocentrum lima (in Vigo, Spain). While most organisms of this group are mesophilic, P. arcticus is a psychrophile.The already sequenced Phaeobacter genomes contain several plasmids which encode genes involved in specific adaptations such as secondary metabolism and biofilm formation. The genome of M. algicola comprises the highest number (10) of plasmids found within the Roseobacter clade. Preliminary experiments (pulsed field gel electrophoresis) with some of the organisms proposed to be sequenced showed that these also contain several plasmids of different size. For P. inhibens and P. daeponensis we detected five plasmids in each organism, while for L. methylohalidivorans only one plasmid was found. ","2014-12-08T22:11:55.980Z","2015-03-16T03:17:09.594Z"
